# Project 3 - YelpClone

YelpClone is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [X] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [X] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Search results page
   - [X] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [X] Implement the restaurant detail page.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. There are a lot of auto layout problems in the video that don't correlate to swift 3 and the new Xcode.
2. There should be a guide on how to post a comment and have that POSTed onto the yelp API.

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

- Figuring out how to load more data from the Yelp API was pretty challenging.
